# Pig Latin Translator

This is a simple Pig Latin translator the I created for school.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Create Pig Latin Translator
- [x] Custom draw module to allow for simple, yet consitance outputs
- [x] Config reading and generating

- [ ] Output file, or custom destination
- [ ] Way to seperate main symbols from text
- [ ] Console menu

## Setup

> [!NOTE]
> Though not required as the project is built only using internal packages.
> It is recomended to setup a virtual environment using the [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module.
