# Pig Latin Translator

This is a simple Pig Latin translator the I created for school.

## To-Do List

- [x] Create Pig Latin Translator
- [x] Custom draw module to allow for simple, yet consitance outputs
- [x] Config reading and generating
- [ ] Simple module to toggle Y checking (allows the script to differentiate between Y as a vowel & Y as a consonant)
- [x] Output file, or custom destination
- [x] Way to seperate main symbols from text (semi-support, just ignores all other characters)
- [ ] Console menu
- [ ] Fix loading screen for translating files

## Setup

> [!NOTE]
> Though not required as the project is built only using internal packages.
> It is recomended to setup a virtual environment using the [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module.

Next you will want to make sure you are running python ``3.9`` minimum
